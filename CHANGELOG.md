# Changelog

This file documents the changes made to the Contact Manager app to get it to a working state.

## Summary of Changes

### 1. Fixed Component Exports

- **`src/components/common/CustomInput.js`**: This file was missing an `export default CustomInput;` statement. This caused the app to crash when trying to render the `ContactListScreen` because the `CustomInput` component was not properly exported and couldn't be imported in other files.

- **`src/utils/ContactContext.js`**: The `ContactContext` was not being exported. This caused a crash in `ContactDetailsScreen` which uses this context. The fix was to add the `export` keyword to `ContactContext`.

### 2. Fixed Style Imports

- **`src/screens/ContactDetails/ContactDetailsScreen.js`**: This screen was importing `globalStyles` as a default import, but `globalStyles.js` was using named exports. This was fixed by changing the import to a named import: `import { GlobalStyles } from '../../styles/globalStyles';`.

- **`src/styles/globalStyles.js`**: There was an inconsistency in the naming of the exported style object. It was exported as `globalStyles` but imported as `GlobalStyles`. This was fixed by renaming the export to `GlobalStyles` to match the import.

### 3. Styled `ContactDetailsScreen`

The `ContactDetailsScreen` was very basic. It has been updated with a more modern and user-friendly design. The changes include:

- A header with the contact's avatar and name.
- Action buttons for call, message, and email.
- A card-based layout for contact information.
- A notes section.

## The Reason for Using React Navigation

We use React Navigation to allow users to move between different screens in the app. Specifically, we need it for the following flow:

1.  Show the main contact list (`ContactListScreen`).
2.  When a user taps a contact, show that contact's details (`ContactDetailsScreen`).
3.  Allow the user to go back from the details screen to the list.
4.  Allow the user to navigate to a screen for adding new contacts (`AddContactScreen`).

A `Stack` navigator is the perfect tool for this, as it provides the necessary push/pop navigation style common in mobile apps. The `NavigationContainer` is required to make it all work.
